# Trafficsign_Detection_YoloV5


* The detect section of YOLOv5 is used to perform object detection on images, videos, directories, globs, YouTube, webcam, streams, etc.
* The detect section can be used with a variety of input formats, including PyTorch, TorchScript, ONNX, OpenVINO, TensorRT, CoreML, TensorFlow SavedModel, TensorFlow GraphDef, TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow Edge TPU, and PaddlePaddle.
* The detect section outputs a list of bounding boxes, confidence scores, and class labels for each detected object.
* The detect section can be used to detect a variety of objects, including people, cars, animals, and objects.
* The detect section is a powerful tool for object detection and can be used for a variety of applications, such as security, surveillance, and robotics.

Here are some additional details about the detect section of YOLOv5:

* The detect section uses a single-stage object detection algorithm, which means that it can detect objects in a single pass through the image. This makes the detect section very fast, and it can process images at a rate of around 155 frames per second (fps).
* The detect section is trained on the COCO dataset, which is a large dataset of images that contain objects. This training data allows the detect section to accurately detect a variety of objects.
* The detect section can be used to detect objects in real time. This makes it a valuable tool for security, surveillance, and robotics applications.
